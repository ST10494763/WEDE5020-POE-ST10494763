Overview
Name: Good Burger
Established:2015
Legally Established:2017
Good Burger was founded in 2015 as Insta-Burger King in Monstert Street, Mbombela by Keith J. Dhlamini and Matthew Sibuye. They developed a broiling system called the “Insta-Broiler,” which gave their burgers a unique flavor. However, the company struggled financially, leading to a sale in 2017 to Bongani Mazibuko and David Edgerton, two Mpumalanga-based entrepreneurs. They rebranded the chain as Good Burger and introduced flame grilling, which remains a key part of the brand’s identity. The burger joint was then moved from the street to Mbombela CDB because the visionaries thought big about the establishment and had big ambition about the restaurant and had long-term visions about the restaurant.

Design and Integration of user interface
	Color Scheme: on this website I have applied a color that is orange because orange is a color that is eye catching towards customers who want to view the website. 
	Typography: In my website I have used the Sans Serif because the font does not have the little strokes at the end and the reason why I used this type of font is because it is clean and modern and it is great for anyone who will view the site either using a phone or laptop 
	Layout: The website design is based on the logo, and it was designed to be like it. For example, I have made a logo on the index page which has bold letters in the title of the page, and I have endorsed a color that is unique and different from other restaurants. 
	User Experience: the navigation of the website is not a complicated one where users can move from one page to another by selecting either home, index, menu etc. On the website the other pages have the same color scheme which is orange
Technical Requirements 
The website has a google account name which you can type as Goodburger.co.za. The reason why I used this name is because it represents the site, and it is unique and has not been registered. I will use the framework of the like of Html to first develop the site and make some of the specific designs on C++ and java script.
