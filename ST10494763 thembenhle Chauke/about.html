        <h3>About Good Burger</h3>
        <P>Established:2015
            Legally Established:2017
            Good Burger was founded in 2015 as Insta-Burger King in Monstert Street, Mbombela by Keith J. Dhlamini and Matthew Sibuye. They developed a broiling system called the “Insta-Broiler,” which gave their burgers a unique flavor. However, the company struggled financially, leading to a sale in 2017 to Bongani Mazibuko and David Edgerton, two Mpumalanga-based entrepreneurs. They rebranded the chain as Good Burger and introduced flame grilling, which remains a key part of the brand’s identity. The burger joint was then moved from the street to Mbombela CDB because the visionaries thought big about the establishment and had big ambition about the restaurant and had long term and short term visions about the restaurant</P>
